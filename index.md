## Welcome to the 0xBitcoin foundation

The 0xBitcoin Foundation was founded in July of 2018 to promote the use, acceptance and development of applications and protocols using the ERC918 and ERC20 standards. We aim to fund and direct developments which we believe will substantially aid this goal, as well as act as a voice for community funded initiatives. We are chosen by the community to represent the community and the technology we believe will become central to development on the Ethereum platform. 

## Please bear with us while the site is under construction and check back for updates!
